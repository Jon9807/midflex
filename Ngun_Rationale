Wireframes:
I use wireframe at the start to the project. It was to give me an idea of where to put each of the elements.  

Cards: 
Cards were used to present content in a structured and visually appealing way. I used it when creating the recipe page. The cards each contained a title, description, and image. The card design made it easy for users to understand and interact with the content.

Media queries:
The hambuger menu in the header file used media queries to adjust its appearance when the screen width is at least 700 pixels (@media screen and (min-width: 700px)).

Flexbox: 
For flexbox the .flex-container class used display: flex and flex-direction: column to ensure a column-based layout in the recipe page.

Less Preprocessor:
I used less to define color variables that were used throughout the stylesheets. I created variables such as, @background-color, @text-color, @box-shadow-color,@box-shadow-hover-color and used them as needed. I also created a few numeric variables such as @card-width, @footer-padding, @transition-duration, and @border-radius

Hamburger Menu and Common Menu Titles:
For the navbar, i created a seperate file called header, which include all the features of the hambuger menu. So instead of individually creating the menu for each of the pages. I just referenced the header file instead. The only thing I changed for the menu is I added a new link called 'form'.


Form Controls:
For form controls, I wasn't sure how to impliment it in the recipe page so I created a sperate page call 'form'. It's similar to the form we worked on for one of the homework. But I changed the content to fit this project. it used form controls (radio buttons, checkboxes, textarea) were implemented to collect user feedback on the web programming recipes.
